# Understanding the docker-compose.yml file

This `docker-compose.yml` file is a configuration file for [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), which is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. Let's break it down line by line.

```{docker}
version: '3.7'

  
services:

	api:

		build: .

		command: uvicorn src.api:app --reload --workers 1 --host 0.0.0.0 --port 80

		volumes:

		 - ./src:/home/app/src

		ports:

		 - "8080:80"
```

### File Structure Overview
- `version`: Specifies the Docker Compose file format version.
- `services`: Defines the services that make up your app.
- `api`: Name of the first (and in this case, only) service.
- `build`: Specifies the [build context for Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/#:~:text=The%20docker%20build%20command%20builds,a%20file%20in%20the%20context.) (the set of files located in the specified PATH or URL).
- `command`: Specifies the command to run inside the container.
- `volumes`: Maps a host directory to a directory inside the container.
- `ports`: Maps ports between the host and the container.

### Line-by-line Explanation

1. `version: '3.7'`:  
This line sets the version of the Docker Compose file format to 3.7. Different versions have different features and syntax, so it's important to specify which one you're using.

2. `services:`:  
This keyword begins the section where you define each service in your application. A service is  a container running a piece of software.

3. `  api:`:  
This line names the service "api". This name is used to identify the service within the context of the Docker Compose file and could be anything.

4. `    build: .`:  
This tells Docker Compose to build a Docker image using the Dockerfile located in the current directory (`.`).

5. `    command: uvicorn src.api:app --reload --workers 1 --host 0.0.0.0 --port 80`:  
This line specifies the command to run when the container starts. Here, it's starting a Uvicorn server to run a FastAPI application from the `src.api` Python module, using one worker, and it will listen on port 80.

6. `    volumes:`:  
This begins the volumes section. Volumes are used for persisting data and sharing files between the host and the container.

7. `      - ./src:/home/app/src`:  
This line maps the `./src` directory on the host machine to the `/home/app/src` directory inside the container. Any changes to files in this directory will be reflected in both places.

8. `    ports:`:  
This starts the section where you define port mappings between the container and the host machine.

9. `      - "8080:80"`:  
This line maps port 8080 on the host machine to port 80 inside the container. This means if you navigate to `http://localhost:8080` in a web browser on the host machine, you'll interact with the application running on port 80 inside the container.

And that's the entire file! It describes a single service, named "api", that will be built based on the current directory's Dockerfile, run a specific command to start a Uvicorn server, and map directories and ports between the host and the container.
